Kodi builder

This isn't quite finished:
 - I had to manually re-add the cmdline.txt to get sound through HDMI to work
 - Useful add-ons that I've done post installation that should be added:
   - https://github.com/CastagnaIT/plugin.video.netflix/wiki/How-install-the-addon
   - https://www.kodivpn.co/how-to-watch-disney-plus-on-kodi/
   - https://www.expressvpn.com/support/vpn-setup/app-for-raspberry-pi/#download
   
And I also need to install ExpressVPN
